Many thanks to:
    https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xix-deployment-on-docker-containers
    for the help. Couldn't have done it without him + a dozen other internet strangers with who had encountered
    similar issues to mine

First: install docker-stuff

then run these two commands from the top-level directory of the project
    docker build -t doggo:latest .
    docker run --name doggo -d -p 8000:5000 --rm doggo:latest # names the container for easier debugging etc

if things start crashing run this command instead, it will print the logs directly to the terminal
    docker run --name doggo -i -p 8000:5000 doggo:latest
